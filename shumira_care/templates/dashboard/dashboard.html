                <h2 class="display-5 text-dark mb-4 fw-bold">The Beginning</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">Shumira care was founded by Tariro and Esther Kanyemba. Their aim was to provide home care in their local community after witnessing how families often feel ill-equipped and overwhelmed when their loved one suddenly needs care at home. They witnessed the importance of person-centered care, quality care, and the impact it can have on individuals and their loved ones.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Mission</strong> is to champion quality care and make training easily accessible to anyone.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Vision</strong> is to see a transformation in the way we approach care.</p>

                <h2 class="display-5 text-dark mb-4 fw-bold">Our Why</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">What if, like many families around the world, you find yourself and your family having to care for an elderly loved one at home? This could be your partner, parent or grandparent. Individuals and families often feel ill-equipped and overwhelmed when their loved one suddenly needs care at home. Furthermore, many people are having to leave the workforce or are requiring time off due to the pressures and constraints of caring for a loved one. We believe every one of us has the potential to be a carer and play a massive role in helping solve our social care systems. As a family, we have had the privilege of coming together and providing 24/7 care for our grandparents, all the way to the end of their lives. This is something we believe a lot of families will have to face in the future, not only due to a shortage of carers, but because most people desire to remain and be cared for at home. </p>
                <p class="text-muted">So, we understand the pain that families feel when going through this inevitable chapter of life. We also understand the joy it can bring when families provide care to their loved ones, and how this can unify and strengthen family bonds. We would love for you to come with us on this journey.
